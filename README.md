The purpose of this course for students with no prior knowledge of databases, is to learn relational database concepts. This course helps students to acquire and practice and see the difference between PL/SQL and MySQL languages. It is also thought to get them ignited with performing SQL access in a data science context.  

The importance of this course is on hands-on and efficient learning. The students work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets on their individual space. They will create a database instance in the server; we created for them with the same privileges. Through a series of hands-on practices, they follow the building and running SQL queries in both Oracle and MySQL environments. They further learn how to access databases using XML and PHP, also from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python-panda.
